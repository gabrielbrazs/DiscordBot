            "Once a week you can roll abilities for half the price on **Tuesday 16:00 PST** to **Wednesday 15:59 PST**\n(Keep the difference in timezones in mind!)",
            "The ability \"Recovery amount\" boosts how much health you receive from recovery magi. However the bonus only applies to yourself, other people still get healed for the default amount.",
            "The parry mechanic from a burst sns can protect you from any negative status effect, even death. You can keep going at one health point if you manage to master the parry mechanic.",
            "You can sell multiple ability crystals at once by going into the ability change menu, selecting \"Crystal Fusion\" and then \"Sell multiple\"",
            "Recovery magi with an area of effect are able to deal damage against undead behemoths. (e.g. Venoma, Lich or Nura to name a few)",
            "Unlike most gauge mechanics, the bullets in a burst great sword do not disappear after you die.",
            "Hard mode in the main story's second season can be unlocked by reaching level 150.",
            "Since an aegis is just another layer of HP, it cannot protect you from status ailments. Things like burn or poisoin will bypass the magi and drain your health from under the shield.",
            "Soul dual blades are the only weapon that can stagger a behemoth from hitting a normal weak spot, however only if you hit it with a demon blast at maximum charge. Other weapons need the special weak spot to stagger.",
            "A spear's onslaught works on a fixed amount of time no matter how much attack speed you have, however what changes with the ability/buff is how many times you can poke a behemoth in the meanwhile.\n(Theoretically you could charge a full heat bar with enough attack speed)",
            "The healing you receive from soul spear's charge attack cannot be boosted by \"Recovery Amount\" abilities, only by set specific \"Rend Heal Amount\" ones like Mercura.",
            "In resistance battles all of your gauges have toned down charge rates. (e.g. Heat gauges, soul gauges, magi gauges)",
            "The guaranteed SS pull takes all banners into account when counting the five pulls you need, letting you receive the bonus on any active banner. Keep in mind that magi and behemoth pull mechanics are separate.",
            "The level of a fodder does not change the amount of EXP gained when awakening magi, only the rarity can change it. Also you can only awaken something using the same magi type, but passives are able to awaken all types.",
            "The abilities from unequipped weapons in your sub-slots also stack to boost the one in your hands, this is the reason why so many people carry three of the same weapons.",
            "Some attacks are able to shorten the recovery time after a roll, letting you chain rolls and move much faster than normal. (e.g. Guarding on a SnS, kneeling shots on bows and the spin attack on soul spears)",
            "Raid bosses in a field usually have three sub-missions that reward you for one gem each, with another bonus gem by completing all of them, for a total of 4 gems per behemoth. Useful when you need extra gems after finishing the events.",
            "When a behemoth sends you flying, you are able to perform an action roll and recover faster instead of laying down on the floor. This can be done by tapping the screen before you finish falling.",
            "You can break field objects, like rocks and logs, just like a behemoth if you blast them with a burst great sword shot.",
            "Behemoths able to counter magi cannot react when incapacitated, so should you manage to paralyze/fatigue/restrain one then be quick with your cast to sneak in some damage!"]
